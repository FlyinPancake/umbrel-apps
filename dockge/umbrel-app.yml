  Dockge is a fancy, easy-to-use and reactive self-hosted docker compose.yaml stack-oriented manager to run custom Docker 
  containers on your Umbrel.

  üõ†Ô∏è Dockge on Umbrel is for power users, follow these best practices to avoid issues:


  1. Data persistence: Make sure to only used named Docker volumes for your stacks and containers. Data in bind-mounted
  volumes will be lost when the Portainer app is restarted or updated.


  2. Port management: Watch out for potential port conflicts between your custom containers and umbrelOS' service containers,
  apps you have installed from the Umbrel App Store or Community App Stores, and any apps you go to install in the future.


  3. Container restart policy: Set your containers to "unless-stopped" or "always" restart policies. This will allow your containers
  to restart automatically when the Portainer app is restarted or updated.


  4. Web access to containers: Access your custom containers in your browser at umbrel.local:<mapped-port>. For example, for a container
  with a web UI running on port 4545, navigate to umbrel.local:4545 to access it.
